How to use?
To download music videos for all songs on your clone hero songs folder, run the python script and point the clone_hero_songs_dir variable in the script to your songs folder that contains all songs. Make sure ffmpeg and yt-dlp is installed and in your system path, wait and see all songs folder be populated with a video.mp4.
